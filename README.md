# Machine Learning
Given here are Machine Learning concepts project details
## Ensemble
Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models. This approach allows the production of better predictive performance compared to a single model.(source 1)

The code is written in R. Total 10 models used out of which different combinations of models used for ensemble. Models used:- RRF, earth, blackboost, ctree, gam, cubist, glmboost, randomGLM, ksvm, M5P  

**Model** directory lists all models individually.

## Stock Predictor Project
Libraries used- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, quandl, sklearn
Basic stock prediction model is prepared using **Linear Regression** algorithm. Although Linear Regression is not suitable for prediction of stock prices because of uncertain variations and effects of lot of factors(some of which cannot be measured) involved in stock prices.
The purpose of project is to get hands-on experience in important and basic Machine Learning and Data Science concepts.
